# Part 2: Predicting outcomes of individual games based on recent game averages:
* Install the library NBA API (can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/), along with Pandas, numpy, Matplotlib, and Scikit learn
* Open the file named predict_outcome.py. This is the main file. Run it, and it will print the accuracy scores for one model run on the Chicago Bulls 2010-11 season, and generate the figures as mentioned in the specifications. Will save 4 .png figures in total.
* To predict the outcome of an upcoming game, open and run predict_next.py. Follow the instructions as detailed in the terminal to obtain the prediction for the next game of a given NBA team. The implementation is user-input-friendly and responds well to errors, so simply following the instructions will suffice.
